    <h1>Easy Food</h1>
    <p>Almost everybody loves eating food, but if you're like me, cooking food is a chore.
      On this website I will give you some quick, easy and <em>delicious</em> (at least some times) vegetarian recipes.</p>
    <p>So get up from the couch, march to the store, and make some food!</p>
